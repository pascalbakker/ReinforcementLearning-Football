**Reinforcement Learning Final Project**

Group Members: Florina Asani, Pascal Bakker, Amisha Jindal, Oscar Garcia Fernandez

Complex games such as football are difficult for A.I. to solve. However, one particular type of A.I., reinforcement learning, offers the capability of developing a high performance algorithm for such games. This project seeks to investigate different types of reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly, policy based algorithms, to evaluate which ones perform optimally in multi-agent environments. 

We trained and experimented with 4 algorithms:
1. Double DQN
2. PPO
3. TRPO
4. A3C

The individual folders contain the required dependencies, code, trained models and demo videos of the respective algorithms.
